\chapter{Background}

This chapter provides a literature review on Manifold Learning, including classic approaches, supervised and semi-supervised methods and uses of manifolds for functional regularization.  A review of the Multiple Instance Learning framework for learning from weak and ambiguous labels is provided. Additionally, this chapter reviews the existing literature in sensor fusion, focusing heavily on manifold alignment and fusion of heterogeneous and multi-resolution data types.  A brief review on data processing over graphs is also included.  Reviews describe basic terminology and definitions.  Foundational approaches are described and advances are addressed.
