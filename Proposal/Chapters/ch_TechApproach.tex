\chapter{Technical Approach}
In this chapter, we present the proposed method for discriminative dimensionality reduction using weakly-supervised learning. In the current state of the literature, few methods have been developed which address the problem of dimensionality reduction and manifold learning using weak labels under the multiple-instance learning framework.  Among the proposed methods, none address the possibility of nonlinearity in the underlying manifold representing bags or instances. To this end, this proposal presents a plan of research to fill this gap in the literature.  Specifically, we aim to provide a generalized framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction under the multiple instance learning paradigm which promotes instance-level discriminability in the latent embedding space.  This proposal only considers the binary classification problem, which is motivated by target detection in remote  sensing. The approaches developed in this work will be directly compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.  The remainder of this chapter is divided into two sections.  In the first section, we describe the initial work in investigating the efficacy of strictly supervised, nonlinear manifold learning methods for bag-level classification.  In the second section, we present the proposed approach for instance-level classification.
