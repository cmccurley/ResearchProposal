%%-----------List of Symbols, Nomenclature or Abbreviation--------

%% Please note: a list of Symbols, terms, acronyms, etc. is not usually the best practice.
%% More often you should simply define an abbreviation the first time it is used.
%% If you DO need to include a list like this please notice that it must be paginated manually
%% by breaking it up into page size tables. Longtable will not wrap the definition properly if
%% it extends to a second line and a similar issue is encountered when the tabbing environment
%% is used. If you have a better way of meeting the Editorial Office requirements I'd love to hear about it.
